OKAY WELCOME TO COOL CHAT APP,

THIS IS GOING TO BE A FUN RIDE

ESPECIALLY THE STORY ON HOW THIS WAS MADE

//* LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I HAVE STAYED UP 160 HOURS MAYBE I DONT KNOW DOING THIS PROJECT AS WELL AS TRYING TO DEEEEBUG WHATEVER IS WRONG WITH IT
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE THIS GOD FORSAKEN API LISTEN I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID TO THIS THING ANYMORE
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION AND COLLECT THE THE SIGN UP INFORMATION FOR AN ACCTUAL ACCOUNT ON THE WEBSITE BUT TO BE FAIR I PLANNED ON TAKING IT DOWN AFTER PRESENTATION BEING I DONT WANT THIS BEING USED FOR ANYTHING SKEEVY

POSTMAN IS THE ISSUE
I COULD HAVE SOMETHING WRITTEN WRONG ON MY CONFIG FILE, BUT THE CONTROLLERS/AUTHCONTROLLER.JS IS BUGGED TO ALL HELL IT SEEMS
MY MIGRATIONS FOLDER STARTED ACTING WEIRD AS WELL. AS WELL AS A COUPLE OTHERS, MY CODE IS CLEAN AND WAS WORKING, BUT ONCE I STARTED FRONT END AND CHANGED SOME BACK END THINGS, IT SEEMED TO JUST FLOP ON ME. 

i have spent MY ENTIRE monday morning/night its currently 2:26am as i write this and i am freaking out because its 8/31

WHAT IS WRONG WITH THISSSSS

anyway the react and front end stuff worked like a charm and i take pride in my ability to use react and scss and all this jazz it was a fun project, especially with the never ending battle of debugging 


but anyway

/* as i stated before i will only be hosting this for about a week being it is kinda sketchy to have a unmonitored chat application up and it can get sketchy.


In this project i learned the ins and outs of React, Socket.io, Flexbox, a more sturdy understanding of Scss after doing it in my foundations final project, i figured id incorporate it even further, i also learned how to use chatkit, as well as making routers. My skills in using Node have increased but my knowledge on API's needs work, i can not for the life of me get the back end to work in terms of connecting to a data base and or postman (postgreSQL/PgAdmin4/Postman)

In this project i spent countless hours as stated in the backend readme doing this project, and i would like to say that my skills in googling, watching videos, possibly even debugging my own work has gotten better, and my understanding in the subject is great in my honest opinion.

Whats crazy is i even lost my old project for this, and this is the New one that i did. With even more FLAREEEEE

I hope everyone likes it. I worked very hard on it.
